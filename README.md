### Why does this repository exists?
Some time ago, I looked at [Apple's fonts page](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) and found out that the files are in `.dmg` format, meaning they can only be extracted with a Mac. Well, as a Windows user it felt not fair at all, so I opened my Mac virtual machine
and did exactly that, so more people can use the fonts, in websites and more.
